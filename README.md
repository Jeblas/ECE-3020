Mathematical Foundations of Computer Engineering
## Course Desription
Fundamental concepts in discrete mathematics and their efficient realization via algorithms, data
structures, computer programs, and hardware. Discussion of engineering and computational
applications. 
## Course Objective
* learn fundamental concepts of discrete mathematics,
* apply discrete math to the solution of problems in electrical and computer engineering, and
* analyze algorithms and design hardware and software to realize discrete math concepts as computational artifacts.
## Course Outcomes
* use proof techniques, such as induction, to prove mathematical lemmas,
* analyze the running times of iterative and recursive algorithms,
* solve counting problems involving permutations, combinations, and selections,
* apply probabilistic methods to the design and analysis of randomized algorithms,
* design algorithms and write programs for constructing and manipulating common data abstractions, e.g. lists, trees, and graphs
* analyze the running times of common algorithms for trees, graphs, and networks,
* use a context-free grammar to define the syntax of a simple programming language,
* choose appropriate data abstractions and apply discrete math concepts in solving multiple types of electrical and computer engineering problems.
